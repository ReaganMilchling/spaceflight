This was one of my first games ever made in processing. It was my first time exploring adding images and sprites to a program. 

None of the art is mine, it was only used for educational purposes. 

It has a lot of bugs and I would like to recreate it outside of processing like the Wave game. I would like to get rid of the floating functions outside of a class (granted processing java is different from normal java so this isn't that bad), fix the hitboxes, and overall make the game more user friendly and fun.
